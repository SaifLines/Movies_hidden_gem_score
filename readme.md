# Movies_hidden_gem_score

There is a website, FlixGem https://flixgem.com (https://flixgem.com), which collects data from different sources and produces what they call a “Hidden Gem” score, which users then use to choose new movies and television series to watch that they might not come across. 
The data for this project comes from a Kaggle project, the details of which can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/syedmubarak/netflix-datasetlatest-2021.


The goal of this analysis is to identify a relation between movies hidden gem score and other factors such as the language of the movie, the runtime, scores of other movie rating websites (such as IMDB and rotten tomatoes) and directors.
